## 📖 What is Dispatcharr?

Dispatcharr is an **open-source powerhouse** for managing IPTV streams, EPG data, and VOD content with elegance and control.\
Born from necessity and built with passion, it started as a personal project by **[OkinawaBoss](https://github.com/OkinawaBoss)** and evolved with contributions from legends like **[dekzter](https://github.com/dekzter)**, **[SergeantPanda](https://github.com/SergeantPanda)** and **Bucatini**.

> Think of Dispatcharr as the \*arr family's IPTV cousin — simple, smart, and designed for streamers who want reliability and flexibility.

## 🎯 What Can I Do With Dispatcharr?

Dispatcharr empowers you with complete IPTV control. Here are some real-world scenarios:

💡 **Consolidate Multiple IPTV Sources**\
Combine streams from multiple providers into a single interface. Manage, filter, and organize thousands of channels with ease.

📺 **Integrate with Media Centers**\
Use HDHomeRun emulation to add virtual tuners to **Plex**, **Emby**, or **Jellyfin**. They'll discover Dispatcharr as a live TV source and can record programs directly to their own DVR libraries.

📡 **Create a Personal TV Ecosystem**\
Merge live TV channels with custom EPG guides. Generate XMLTV schedules or use auto-matching to align channels with existing program data. Export as M3U, Xtream Codes API, or HDHomeRun device.

🔧 **Transcode & Optimize Streams**\
Configure output profiles with FFmpeg transcoding to optimize streams for different clients — reduce bandwidth, standardize formats, or add audio normalization.

🔐 **Centralize VPN Access**\
Run Dispatcharr through a VPN container (like Gluetun) so all streams route through a single VPN connection. Your clients access geo-blocked content without needing individual VPNs, reducing bandwidth overhead and simplifying network management.

🚀 **Monitor & Manage in Real-Time**\
Track active streams, client connections, and bandwidth usage with live statistics. Monitor buffering events and stream quality. Automatic failover keeps viewers connected when streams fail—seamlessly switching to backup sources without interruption.

👥 **Share Access Safely**\
Create multiple user accounts with granular permissions. Share streams via M3U playlists or Xtream Codes API while controlling which users access which channels, profiles, or features. Network-based access restrictions available for additional security.

🔌 **Extend with Plugins**\
Build custom integrations using Dispatcharr's robust plugin system. Automate tasks, connect to external services, or add entirely new workflows.

## 🚀 Get Started in Minutes

### 🐳 Quick Start with Docker (Recommended but I don't use it as I use my own docker compose file)

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dispatcharr/dispatcharr:latest
docker run -d \
  -p 9191:9191 \
  --name dispatcharr \
  -v dispatcharr_data:/data \
  ghcr.io/dispatcharr/dispatcharr:latest
```

> Customize ports and volumes to fit your setup.

### 🐋 Docker Compose Options

| Use Case                    | File                                                    | Description                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **All-in-One Deployment**   | [docker-compose.aio.yml](docker/docker-compose.aio.yml) | ⭐ Original Recommendation! A simple, all-in-one solution — everything runs in a single container for quick setup.        |
| **Modular Deployment**      | [docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yml)         | Separate containers for Dispatcharr, Celery, Redis, and Postgres — perfect if you want more granular control. |
| **Development Environment** | [docker-compose.dev.yml](docker/docker-compose.dev.yml) | Developer-friendly setup with pre-configured ports and settings for contributing and testing.                 |
| **My Own Deployment (Tito**   | [docker-compose.repostudy-aio.yml](docker/docker-compose.repostudy-aio.yml) | ⭐ This is what I use so it can have my own changes. If the others don't work then use this one.        |

---

###  My own Deployment Instructions

When using the specialized **Repostudy AIO** configuration, you must first create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Create .env from template
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your DOMAIN (e.g., DOMAIN=localhost:9191 or DOMAIN=mydomain.com)
```

Then run the build and apply migrations:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.repostudy_aio.yml up -d --build

# Apply database migrations
docker exec -it dispatcharr_repostudy /bin/bash -c "source /etc/profile.d/dispatcharr.sh && python manage.py makemigrations accounts"
docker exec -it dispatcharr_repostudy /bin/bash -c "source /etc/profile.d/dispatcharr.sh && python manage.py migrate"
```

### 🆙 Updating and Pushing Changes

If you make changes to the code and want to push them to your GitHub fork and update your GHCR images, use the provided helper script:

1. **Push code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```

2. **Update GHCR Images:**
   ```bash
   # Update the main application image (most common)
   ./scripts/publish.sh app

   # If you changed pyproject.toml or dependencies, update the base image first
   ./scripts/publish.sh base
   # Then update the app
   ./scripts/publish.sh app
   ```
